# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# INTRODUCTION
Todo App! Developed during my Celebal Summer Internship, this application is designed to offer users a feature-rich and intuitive to-do management system. Built with React and SCSS, it guarantees a seamless and adaptable experience across mobile devices. The standout among its features is the incredible interface, streamlining task management for an effortless and enjoyable experience.

# FUNCTIONALITIES

Switch Between Grid and List Views:
Customize your todo management experience by seamlessly switching between grid and list views, tailored to your preferences.

Secure Local Storage:
Your todo data is safely stored in the user's local storage, eliminating the need for external databases

Track and Update Todo Status:
Keep a clear overview of your tasks' progress. Easily mark them as complete or incomplete as needed.
 
Effortlessly Add and Organize Todos:
Efficiently manage your tasks by easily adding new items to your to-do list and organizing them with ease.

# HOW TO OPEN
Start the development server.
npm start
To access the app in your preferred web browser, simply type or paste the following URL: http://localhost:3000. This will open the application for you to explore and utilize its features

# App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
